HopeConnect is a platform created to address urgent issues such as homelessness, hunger, and lack of education that millions of people worldwide encounter. It aims to alleviate difficulties in accessing basic necessities and provide support to those combating these problems.

Rooted in a profound sense of emotional responsibility and solidarity, HopeConnect fosters collective efforts to ensure universal basic human rights. It serves as a beacon of hope where individuals from all walks of life come together to extend a helping hand, thereby making a positive global impact.

The technology infrastructure behind HopeConnect is carefully designed to facilitate the achievement of its goals. A robust and reliable backend development utilizing ASP.NET Core 8 forms the backbone of the platform. While Microsoft SQL Server is preferred for data storage and processing, modern cloud technologies such as Google Cloud Storage and Firebase are utilized to enhance user experience and accessibility.

Through the integration of these technologies, HopeConnect aims to provide users with an easily accessible, secure, and user-friendly platform. This facilitates the swift and effective provision of support to those in need, ultimately aiming to bring about positive change and improvement on a global scale.

HopeConnect particularly focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations, including Zero Hunger, No Poverty, and Quality Education. By targeting these goals, the platform aims to provide solutions to issues such as reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and increasing access to education.

In the development of the mobile application, technologies such as React Native, Google Maps Platform, axios, and Asp.Net Core API have been employed. React Native accelerates development by allowing a single codebase to run on both iOS and Android platforms. The Google Maps Platform is utilized for location services, enabling users to locate nearby individuals in need and send assistance. Axios facilitates HTTP requests and communication with the server, while Asp.Net Core API manages the backend data processing and server logic.

The integration of these technologies results in a mobile application that offers a user-friendly, secure, and efficient experience. Users can easily request assistance, provide aid to those in need, and engage with other users on the platform.

Developed with HopeConnect: Empowering Change through Technology

HopeConnect is a platform designed to address urgent issues such as homelessness, hunger, and lack of education encountered by millions worldwide. The primary aim of this project is to alleviate the difficulties in accessing basic necessities and provide support to those combating these challenges. To achieve this goal, HopeConnect leverages various technologies:

React Native: React Native was used in the development of the mobile application. It provides a single codebase that can run on both iOS and Android platforms, thus accelerating the development process and reducing costs.

Google Maps Platform: The Google Maps Platform is integrated to provide users with location-based services. This allows for the visualization of aid resources on a map and facilitates users' access to nearby assistance points.

axios: The axios library is employed for making HTTP requests and communicating with the server. It manages data exchange processes and enables user interaction with the platform.

React Native Navigation: React Native Navigation is utilized for managing the user interface. It simplifies navigation within the application and enhances the user experience.

Asp.Net Core Api Integration: Asp.Net Core Api integration is implemented to manage backend data processing and server logic. It ensures secure processing and storage of user data.

Async Storage: Async Storage is used for local storage of mobile application data. It securely stores user data on the device and allows for easy access when needed.

React Native Image Picker: React Native Image Picker is integrated to enable users to select photos and media files. This simplifies the process of uploading and sharing media files within the application.

HopeConnect aims to provide users with a secure, accessible, and effective assistance platform. By integrating these technologies, we believe we are taking a significant step towards bringing about positive change and development on a global scale.
